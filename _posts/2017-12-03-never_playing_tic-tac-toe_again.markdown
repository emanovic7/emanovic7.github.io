Over a year after starting this curriculum, and having familiarized myself with React, Redux, Rails, Javascript, ActiveRecord, etc, I decided to start my first Portfolio Project. I skipped these (portfolio projects at the end of each major section) for a reason; so I would be forced to review each section of the course. And boy, did I need a review on Object Oriented Ruby. 

I watched a few of Avi's videos, and revisited the simpler tic-tac-toe labs we do earlier in the course, which helped. Most of the project isn't difficult, with the main challenge being able to build an AI that's impossible to beat. That alone took about two weeks to figure out. But after googling and harrassing other students for help, I did write a code I am somewhat proud of. I mean, I have an intelligent AI that none of my friends have been able to beat.

I will go have a drink before starting my next portfolio project, I think I've earned this one. 
Maybe this night's sleep won't be filled with dreams of If statements and broken CLIs.
