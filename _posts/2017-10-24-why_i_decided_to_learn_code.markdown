My first experience with coding was learning Matlab, a requirement of the Physics curriculum at my university. Before then, 
I mostly used computers for studying, browsing the internet, and occasionally playing chess or FIFA. 
I was fascinated by Matlab, that a few simple lines would get the program to do amazing things. I worked with a BioPhysicist
temporarily in college, and the things she could get her microscope and other lab equipment to do via Matlab were impressive. I was hooked. After a little investigation, I found out Matlab was built on an actual Programming Language, C++, so I bought the instructional book written by Bjarne Stroustrup (whom unbeknownst to me, also penned my favourite quote of all time; "I like to eat, and therefore I run."). While the introductory part and first seven or so chapters were easy, it soon proved to be very difficult to follow. That, and being in my junior year in Physics made it impossible to learn C++. 
When I started working in Design Engineering after school, I'd try to follow the book a few hours a week. 
I won't ever give up on learning to code properly, or coding in general. I work in Solar Engineering and have a few plans to 
build Solar Farms in my native Ghana, but I can see myself always working with code in some way. 
Some days it's easy and clicks right away, other days my Quantum Mechanics lectures made more sense. But coding is creative, forces you to think, it really pushes you. That's why I named this blog after Tolkien's masterpiece; learning to code is like getting to Mordor. I will get there.
