I started this project about five weeks ago. It's a little web application that keeps track of a collection; I went with books. Most people probably did. Simple, right? No, not really. I have already read up on rails and finished about 95% of labs and assignments in that chapter. It's supposed to be easier than Sinatra, and it kind of is, but I like Sinatra more. 
So why did I skip my portfolio project to spend another month or so on Rails? I don't know, but I get stuck a lot; sometimes on simple things that I easily figure out after giving up and reading my code line by line (fun). Sometimes, it's bigger, or more annoying; I mispelled a model association, or table, or misunderstood an entire section on Sinatra (re-read said section, also fun). So it's move on to something else or drive myself crazy. 
But that's part of the learning experience, I suppose. In the movies and TV shows, the genius coders type away, making no mistakes. In real life I sometimes forget where the percent sign is and have to look for it.  Sort of reminds me of my Physics homeworks back in college. Some topics take weeks to figure out, but you do, provided you beat at it enough. But again, in TV and in movies, the geniuses just figure out the Fourier Transforms of a wave equation in 5 minutes. 
It's 2:35 AM here in NYC, I have been working on this project since 9AM (although I took a 2 hour break to work out, and another hour or so to eat and watch an episode of the Office). I am almost done and will submit this tomorrow (or later today if you're a capt. Pedantic). I just have to figure out my books' subjects selection. Hopefully, like a genius, it'll take me a few hours. Hopes aren't hight.  But that's for later. Goodnight!
