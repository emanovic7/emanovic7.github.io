This one took a while, I think I'll come back to polish it up and make it much 'proper.'

So, this portfolio project is on creating gems. I started over a month ago, but between working as a Solar Engineer and tutouring, I couldn't make more than 5 hours a week. I have watched Avi's CLI Gem Walkthrough video so many times I can recite it now, which is good, because I think my OO Ruby skills have improved significantly. 
My gem is a soccer gem (Europen football is life), from which a user is given quick access to one of five leagues' most important information (we usually only care about which team is on top of the table, who the top scorer is, and who has the most assists. Messi tops the latter two for the Spanish league, I could have hard coded that).
I didn't have much trouble with my OO patterns; as I've aleardy mentioned, watched Avi's walkthrough vidoe and googled many many times. My biggest challenge was scraping, and finding a website that wasn't too complicated. Scraping is probably something you master or don't, something you love or hate. I don't know where I fall on either spectrum. 

Looking forward to the review on this one. It's 12:45 AM in NYC, and I have an Engineering Meeting at 8 AM in New Jersey. 
Perhaps I'll be more relieved on NJIT ride tomorrow morning, because I feel nothing right now, unlike my AI project. Night. 

Ps. Sorry but I suck at blogging, this is my third or so. Maybe I should blog more, like when I am stuck on any project.
